   ecology_engine.js - community ecology + evolution, agent-based. Joe's spec,
   2026-08-28. PURE SIMULATION: no DOM, no clocks, seeded randomness - the
   same file runs in the wall page and under the jsc test harness, so the
   ecology can be balance-tested at thousands of steps per second before a
   pixel is drawn (the exoplanets.js pattern: the page must never be the only
   way to run the model).

   THE SPEC, and where this file departs from or fills in silence:

   GRID  160 x 90. Each cell grows grass: +1 unit on a bare cell, x1.10 on an
   occupied one. DECISION (spec silent): grass is capped at grassMax - 10%
   compounding is exponential and an uncapped cell out-runs every herbivore
   in ~50 steps; the cap makes standing crop a real, exhaustible resource.

   ANIMALS carry legs, body, mouth, eyes as integers 0..10 and fat as a
   continuous store. One action per step: MOVE up to legs distance (radius),
   EAT grass (gains min(MOUTH, grass here), always succeeds), EAT an animal
   in the same cell, or MATE. The mouth is the feeding organ for BOTH diets
   (Joe, 2026-08-28: the original "eat one body amount" left mouth costless
   for herbivores - it prices offspring and inflates concealment size but
   bought nothing - and selection promptly bred M0 herbivores that grazed
   perfectly well. Mouth-limited intake gives the trait an honest benefit:
   a mouthless animal starves, and a big body needs a big mouth to fuel).

   PREDATION (Joe's rules, 2026-08-28/29):
   - GAPE, strict: the predator's mouth must EXCEED the prey's body -
     equal no longer swallows equal, which closes self-predation for every
     species whose mouth does not out-size its own body.
   - CONCEALMENT (replacing the original flat 50%): with S = the prey's
     legs+body+fat, a prey standing in grass >= S is caught only 10% of the
     time; below that, success rises linearly to 100% on bare ground. An
     overgrazed commons is a killing field, fat is a visibility cost, and
     tall grass is worth fighting over. MOUTH WAS REMOVED from S (Joe,
     2026-08-28): a big mouth is not a big silhouette, and while it sat in
     this term it made mouth a triple liability, which is what drove every
     observed regime flip one way.
   - CARCASS RECOVERY (2026-09-01, replacing the old conversion efficiency):
     a kill yields a FRACTION OF WHAT EACH PREY TISSUE COST TO BUILD -
     3.23/legs, 2.925/body, 0.105/mouth, 0.012/eyes, 0.92/fat - the fraction
     being accessibility x digestibility from the carcass-utilisation
     literature. Nothing about the PREDATOR's own build enters: the old
     0.9 - 0.04 x (eyes+legs) discount had no support anywhere and its floor
     sat below any measured recovery. Energy balance is structural: a
     predator can never get more out of a body than went into it.

   MATING needs a partner on the same or adjacent cell with EQUAL legs,
   body, mouth, eyes AND THE SAME DIET (Joe, 2026-08-28: a carnivore and an
   herbivore are different species however alike their bodies - the keys,
   the table and the phylogeny already said so, and mating now agrees). So
   "species" is not a label here, it is trait-identity, and every mutation
   - a diet flip most of all - is a step toward reproductive isolation.
   Both parents need fat above the build cost legs+body+mouth (plus the
   reserve parameter below); per offspring each parent pays half the build
   cost, and pairs keep producing while both stay eligible.
   DECISION (spec silent): a newborn starts with babyFat units of its own -
   born at zero it would starve before its first act - and each parent pays
   half of that too. Parents share a diet, and the newborn inherits it
   (unless mutation flips it).

   MUTATION: 5% per birth. One of five equally likely outcomes: legs, body,
   mouth or eyes shifts +-1, or the diet flips between herbivore and
   carnivore. TRAIT FLOORS (Joe, 2026-08-28): legs and eyes may reach 0 -
   sessile and blind are real body plans - but body and mouth bottom out
   at 1: an animal with no body or no mouth is not an animal. (An M0
   creature could eat nothing at all under mouth-limited intake; a B0 one
   was only ever a bookkeeping ghost.) Ceiling 10 for all four.

   PERCEPTION: an animal sees everything within eyes cells of itself -
   grass, animals, and their trait values - and chooses its action to
   satisfy eating, reproduction, and predator avoidance.

   METABOLISM: each step fat falls by 0.1 x (distance moved) + 0.1 x
   max(1, legs + body + eyeCost x eyes) - locomotor AND sensory tissue are
   carried whether or not they are used (Joe, 2026-08-28; formerly body
   alone, then legs+body).
   Below 1 unit of fat the animal starves. Carnivores gain prey legs + body
   + fat; they cannot eat grass (a flipped diet must pay its way by hunting).

   START: four herbivore species, ten animals each, one species per corner.

   THE THREE RISK-TOLERANCE PARAMETERS Joe called out - all in DEFAULTS,
   all with the reasoning beside them:
     reproReserveSteps - reproduction vs starvation: how many steps of body
                         metabolism a parent keeps for itself before it will
                         spend fat on offspring.
     dangerWeight +
     braveryFloor      - predation vs starvation: how strongly a visible
                         predator repels, and how much of that aversion a
                         starving animal abandons.
     mateWeight        - mate finding vs predation: how strongly a visible
                         eligible mate attracts, competing directly with
                         fear in the same score.

  /* --- THE LAND IS NOT UNIFORM (Joe, 2026-08-28) ----------------------
     Every cell draws a growth quality from a spatially autocorrelated
     random field, so the map has good ground and poor ground in PATCHES
     rather than pixel-by-pixel noise. growLo..growHi is the per-step
     compounding rate a cell supports - CENTRED ON 10% (Joe, 2026-08-28),
     so the landscape varies without cutting total productivity the way a
     1%..10% band did - and a bare cell's
     sprouting scales with the same quality, so poor ground both grows
     slowly and recovers slowly. patchRange is the correlation length in
     cells - the "range" of the variogram; patchSill is how much of the
     spread survives normalisation (1 = full 1%..10% span). */
  /* --- TERRITORY (Joe, 2026-08-28) ------------------------------------
     A cell holds at most cellCap animals. A bigger animal - size is
     legs+body at the shipped weights (sizeEyes 0, sizeMouth 0) - can evict
     a smaller one and take its place; the loser is pushed to the nearest
     cell with room. NOTE (audit 2026-09-01): size enters ONLY as a filter
     on which cells are offered as movement candidates - there is no
     dominance term in any score, so an animal never prefers a cell because
     it could take it. Territory is an outcome here, not a behaviour.
     Eviction needs STRICTLY greater size, so trait-identical animals
     cannot displace each other, which lets a mated pair hold a good pixel
     against each other while still yielding to anything larger. This is
     the first benefit size has ever had in the model.

     WHAT COUNTS AS SIZE: legs + body, with eyes and mouth at weights
     sizeEyes and sizeMouth, both 0 since 2026-08-29. Joe, 2026-08-28: mouth
     left the contest because it was the cheapest way to be big - it cost
     nothing in basal metabolism, so selection bought territory with mouth
     and left body pinned at 1. THAT REASON EXPIRED 2026-09-01: mouth now
     costs 0.3/step to run and 0.7/unit to build. Build cost tracks tissue
     mass, and on that basis the mass-implied weights are legs 1.0 : body
     1.18 : mouth 0.18 : eyes 0.02 - so legs+body is already a fair mass
     proxy and the only real gap is mouth at ~0.18 instead of 0. Whether to
     restore it is an open decision; sizeMouth is the knob. */

     for standing room: a hunter arriving at an occupied cell had to evict
     one of the two animals it came to eat, and grazers were pushed off good
     grass by competitors that never touch grass. Per-diet counting keeps
     territory a contest among ecological equals and leaves predation a

  /* ---- r/K PROVISIONING (Joe, 2026-08-29) --------------------------------
     A fifth species-identifying trait, binary: 'f' spends little on each
     newborn, 'F' spends a lot. It replaces the single babyUpkeepSteps dial
     with a strategy the population can evolve, and it is BINARY on purpose -
     a 1..10 version would multiply genotype space tenfold and strand every
     mutant reproductively, worsening the Allee bottleneck it is meant to
     relieve, and would only be bimodal if bimodality happened to emerge.
     Kept inside species identity (unlike, say, eyes and allometry) because
     the cost and the benefit must stay in the same animal: with mixed pairs
     the endowment would follow one parent while both paid, so the expense of
     F would be socialised across partners while the benefit was inherited
     privately - the same shape of bug that let eyes ride on sizeEyes. */
  /* ---- DISTURBANCE (Joe, 2026-08-29) -------------------------------------
     A patch of the world is hit: some of its animals die and some of its
     standing crop is destroyed. The REGIME is a property of a world (drawn
     once per run), while each EVENT draws its own size from that regime - so
     a world has a character, "frequent small fires" or "rare catastrophic
     resets", which is the thing worth correlating outcomes against.

     ANIMAL KILL AND GRASS REMOVAL ARE SEPARATE AXES, deliberately. They pull
     f and F in OPPOSITE directions: clearing animals but leaving the grass
     opens ground with food already standing, which rewards whoever colonises
     fastest (cheap offspring, f); clearing the grass as well forces colonists
     to survive the regrowth gap on their endowment (F). One combined
     magnitude can only ever push one way at a time, so a single world could
     not contain both forces - and both is what a maintained polymorphism
     needs. Set disturbCoupled true to tie them together and get the
     single-axis behaviour back for comparison.

     Two things are deliberately NOT disturbed. The quality field (the soil)
     survives, so recolonisation follows the landscape's existing structure
     rather than starting blank. And the kill is uniformly at random rather
     than size-selective: density-independent mortality is the classic
     condition favouring r-strategists, and biasing it by body size would
     confound the very mechanism this is here to create. */
  /* WALLS (Joe, 2026-08-29). Impassable ridges scattered across the map, to
     break the global synchrony that lets one herbivore wave sweep the whole
     world and leave it bare - measured at a ~150-step cycle with 75-fold
     amplitude. Subdividing space decouples local booms and busts so they
     average out instead of adding up.

     Implemented as BLOCKED CELLS rather than walls between cells, because
     that is far cheaper: a blocked cell is one array read in the movement
     loop, whereas an edge between cells would need the path of every
     multi-cell move traced and tested against every edge it crosses - on the
     hottest loop in the engine. Drawn as thin lines rather than blobs, so
     they cost almost no habitat: a one-cell ridge across a 160-wide map is
     about 1% of the ground.

     was quietly biased AGAINST large-bodied and carnivorous offspring, which
     is the class that kept failing. A diet-flip carnivore was born with three
     steps of fuel and needs two of them just to reach prey (hunting only
     fires from the prey's own cell), so most died mid-approach having never
     attacked - measured: median life 1 step, and 69 steps when given more fat,
     while raising the catch chance from 0.10 to 0.81 changed nothing.
     At 7 the scaled term clears the floor for every body plan, so every

     can build - an absolute refuge handed over by the trait ceiling, not
     earned. Five of ten 500k-step runs escaped into it and ran every trait
     to the ceiling. gapeStrict:false relaxes the test to mouth >= body, so
     the largest predator can still take the largest prey.

     SWITCHED TO >= ON 2026-09-01, measured. Carnivores are diet-flip mutants
     of the herbivores, so a fresh carnivore carries its ancestor's mouth. In

     t~20,000: carnivores fell 174 -> 3 and stayed there for 80,000 steps,
     while explain-mode showed every carnivore seeing ZERO gape-eligible prey
     among 3,000-4,000 fully exposed herbivores. Across 48 runs, 13 had a
     dominant with mouth <= body and carried a median 5 carnivores against 47
     elsewhere; at mouth == body exactly, 0.3% of the prey base was edible
     under > and 100% under >=. The original reason for the strict form -
     newborn cannibalism - is handled by intraguildGap (catchProb is exactly 0

  /* INTRAGUILD SIZE GAP (Joe, 2026-08-29). A carnivore may only take ANOTHER
     CARNIVORE if it is substantially bigger, measured on legs + body + mouth:
     no advantage at all when they are the same size, rising to a free hand at
     intraguildGap units apart. Predation on HERBIVORES is untouched.

     The point is that it forbids cannibalism as a CONSEQUENCE rather than by
     decree - two animals of one species are identical in size, so the term is
     exactly zero and a species can never eat itself. It also opens room for
     more than one carnivore trophic level: a big enough hunter can take
     smaller hunters, but only as a minor part of its diet or when they are
     unusually abundant, which is how intraguild predation actually works.

     into eyes (4.49, the highest of any arm). The two changes are only
     useful together - do not ship one without the other.

     Honest limits: median body slope is NOT better than baseline (-0.018 vs

       BUILD      one-time biosynthetic cost, paid out of parental fat.
                  Tracks tissue MASS. Per gram, tissues cost almost the same to
                  build (muscle 0.135, gut 0.151, bone 0.162 fat-units/g) - lean
                  tissue is 75-80% water and water is free. What differentiates
                  the traits is how much tissue a trait unit buys: legs 35% of
                  lean mass, body 35%, mouth 6% (the gut is a SMALL organ),
                  eyes 0.3%.
       BASAL      per-step running cost. Tracks mass x metabolic RATE, which is
                  a different ordering: the gut is 6% of the mass but 15% of
                  resting metabolism. Non-primate mammal budget (Mink 1981,
